    //2. Adding and removing elements: Create a List of strings and use the Add and Remove methods to add and remove elements from the List. Check out the resulting list in the Inspector.
    //3. Accessing elements: Create a List of floats and print the third element of the List to the console. (Don't forget to add elements to the List in the Inspector).
