// 1.
// Countdown timer: Use the Update method to implement a countdown timer that counts down from a specified number (public variable) of seconds.
// Use the Time.deltaTime property to measure the time elapsed between frames and update the timer accordingly.
// If the timer reaches 0, print out "bumm" and reset the timer! (you will need to define another variable)
//
// 2.
// Scale object: Use the Update method to scale a GameObject up and down. Use the transform.localScale property to change the scale of the GameObject.
// Scale the object between (3, 3, 3) and (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).
// Experiment with the size of change on every update (you can multiply the scale vector with a float value to change the vaule in every 3 dimensions at once).
